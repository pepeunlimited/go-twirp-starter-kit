# ❌ `/protobuf` ❌ 

.proto and generated protobuf files should been shared with `.gitsubmodule` Submodules allow you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository. This lets you clone another repository into your project and keep your commits separate.  

In the starterkit `protogen.sh` is located at `scripts/protogen.sh`
    ``` $ sh scripts/protogen.sh resources/todo.proto ```
